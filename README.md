# Gradient-Descent-algorithm
Basic implementation of iterative gradient descent compared to the mean squared error function.

We use the Loss function E = A*h - b
I calculate h by mean squared error and by using Gradient descent algorithm and compare each values.

Using the gradient descent approach, the trends are as follows:

Both MSE_error and Iterative_error match as follows after only 100 iterations:
